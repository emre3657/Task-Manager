To install npm packages, open the terminal in project folder and type the command "npm install"

If packages are outdated or broken, you can delete the existing dependencies section in package.json and install them one by one like this: "npm install ", example: "npm install express"

!!! Do not forget to set up the .env file !!!

In the .env file, you need to keep your secrets which is db_connection_string or the port. Example in following line:

MONGO_URI=connection_string
PORT=3000 // in development
